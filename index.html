    <h3>India's freedom is the culmination of centuries of struggle, sacrifices, and undying resilience of millions who
        aspired to live in a nation free from foreign rule. The journey to independence, achieved on August 15, 1947,
        was marked by a series of movements, revolutionary acts, and peaceful protests against British colonial rule,
        which had begun in the 17th century with the establishment of the East India Company.</h3>

    <h2>The Roots of Oppression</h2>
    <p>The British initially came to India as traders, but their growing influence led to the establishment of political
        and administrative control. By the mid-19th century, British rule had systematically drained India's wealth and
        resources through exploitative policies. The imposition of heavy taxes, the destruction of traditional
        industries, and the introduction of discriminatory laws created widespread poverty and discontent among
        Indians.</p>
